It sounds so simple. Yet the list of replaced parts is really long (and correspondingly expensive):
New rear derailleur New cassette New chainring New chain New brake and shift levers New front and rear brakes New brake pipes New handlebar tape After the first (not last!) Oiling (the chain) with DryFluid I could not wait to make a first ride and familiarize myself with shifting and braking.</description></item><item><title>Hello SRAM</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/17/hello-sram/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/17/hello-sram/</guid><description>The dice have been thrown. I have made my decision. The parts are ordered. The appointment with the bike mechanic of my confidence is made. After another problem with my rear derailleur and the subsequent decision to replace the rotor rear derailleur is now final that my beloved gravel bike gets an electronic shifting from SRAM.
The conversion will be somewhat larger, since also the chain, the chainring, as well as the brake levers and thus also the brakes must be replaced.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye Rotor</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/14/goodbye-rotor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/14/goodbye-rotor/</guid><description>Last week the rear derailleur broke during my bikepacking tour from Lucerne to Brühl to attend the JavaLand conference, I had already written about it. I built my gravel bike almost two years ago to the day and this is already the second broken rear derailleur in two years. So slowly I lose confidence in my shifting. But what were my reasons for selecting a Rotor drivetrain, what problems I had and above all, what happens next?</description></item><item><title>Black Friday</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/12/black-friday/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/12/black-friday/</guid><description>Freezing cold at -2 °C but sunny - that&amp;rsquo;s how my Friday started. I was really in a good mood, because at least it was dry and the forecast promised for the noon even double-digit plus degrees. After a hearty breakfast I felt sufficiently strengthened and ready for the biggest climb of my four and a half day tour from Lucerne to Brühl near Cologne over a total of 700 km.</description></item><item><title>Redesign &amp; Reboot</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/09/redesign-reboot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2022/03/09/redesign-reboot/</guid><description>If you look closely, you may notice some changes on my website. The layout is now more dynamic and adapts better to smartphones and tablets. Besides the language, you can now also choose between a light and a dark appearance. But not only the design has changed, the biggest adjustment took place under the hood:
Instead of Jekyll, I now use Hugo to generate this website from my posts. The configuration is easier and the directory structure is clearer for me.</description></item><item><title>Keep On Rolling</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2021/12/26/keep-on-rolling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/2021/12/26/keep-on-rolling/</guid><description>New name, new slogan: After a little more than two years, I have now decided to breathe new life into my bikepacking blog with a new name and new slogan. After returning from my tour across the USA with my bicycle in November 2019, first came winter, then Corona. The pandemic has now been in our grip for much longer than we initially thought possible. Of course, this also had an impact on my plans.</description></item><item><title>Imprint</title><link>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/imprint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://keep-on-rolling.ch/en/imprint/</guid><description>Contact Marcus Fihlon

Actual live broadcast event On May 21, 2022, I start my next bike tour.

Actually they are in German, but I will see how I can add English subtitles. For publishing my videos I use my own channel on YouTube:
