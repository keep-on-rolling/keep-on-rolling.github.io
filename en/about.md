This blog is an experiment. I would like to share my years of experience and above all tell my friends and relatives about my travels and excursions with my bicycle.

One of my experiments is that I will film some of my trips and excursions with a camera. With a bit of luck this will result in a [video](/en/videos), which I will also publish.

My "fleet" now includes four bicycles: A trekking and touring bike from Villiger, a folding bike from Brompton, an e-bike from Stromer and a self-built gravel bike. With my Stromer I have already been riding for two and a half months through the USA, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. My Gravel-Bike is the newest of them all and that's also the bike I'm riding most with at the moment. Due to the current pandemic situation, however, mainly in Switzerland and Germany.

Now I hope you enjoy reading my blog and watching my videos, and I'm looking forward to your comments and feedback!

Please do not expect a quick answer. As my blog shows, I ride my bike a lot, and I also take very long bike trips. It is often the case that I have no access to the internet for days or even weeks. So don't be surprised if an answer from me takes some time. Thank you very much for your understanding!
