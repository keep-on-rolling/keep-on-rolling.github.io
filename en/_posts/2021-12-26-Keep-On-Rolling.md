New name, new slogan: After a little more than two years, I have now decided to breathe new life into my bikepacking blog with a new name and new slogan. After returning from my tour across the USA with my bicycle in November 2019, first came winter, then Corona. The pandemic has now been in our grip for much longer than we initially thought possible. Of course, this also had an impact on my plans. But now, at the end of 2021 / beginning of 2022, I am in good spirits that the worst is behind us and that I will soon be able to "go on a big trip" again. Exactly that, as well as the feeling that I have in the process, I want to make clear with the renaming of my blog:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Keep On Rolling***.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Happyness on two wheels*.

My motivation is unbroken! Let's get going!

Yours  
Marcus
