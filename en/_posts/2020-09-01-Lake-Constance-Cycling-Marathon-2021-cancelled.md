Already last year the [Lake Constance Cycling Marathon](https://bodensee-radmarathon.ch/) was cancelled. This year I was very confident, but then came the cancellation for 2021. A pity, a great pity, but I can understand the organizers. It is certainly not easy to organize such a big event in such a way that all Covid 19 regulations of all three countries at Lake Constance can be respected. At least I had a lot of fun during the preparations for the Gold Tour with 220 km. However, the planning for the Lake Constance Cycling Marathon 2022 is already underway. Save the date: September 10, 2022

Yours  
Marcus
