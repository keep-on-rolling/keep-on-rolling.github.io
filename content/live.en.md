When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

There is currently no live broadcast. But I am already planning my next trip. Until this one will begin, you are welcome to watch the past live broadcasts.
